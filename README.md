# BitBurner
My Journey through Bitburner as a starting programmer in Javascript and barely starting my own journey on coding. And these are my scripts.
Also, I have never beginning in Javascript. But I did manage to make my way around the game as I try my best to 
wrap my head around Javascript. I think I did pretty good so far...

Bitburner is a programming-based incremental game that revolves around hacking and cyberpunk themes. The game can be played at https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner or installed through Steam.
